    "definition": "( YTD and Qtly, % ) Beginning in March 2020, 1 means YES, the institution has elected the community bank Leverage ratio (CBLR) framework for the quarter. the community bank leverage ratio (cblr) framework is an optional framework designed to reduce burden by removing the requirements for calculating and reporting risk-based capital ratios for qualifying community banking organizations that opt into the framework. The framework provides a simple measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banking organizations, consistent with section 201 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act. The calculation of the Leverage Ratio is the percent of Tier 1 capital divided average total consolidated assets. Qualifying community banking organizations that elect to use the CBLR framework and that maintain a leverage ratio of greater than 9 percent are considered to have satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the generally applicable capital rule. In addition, these institutions are considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements for section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. If needed, there is a two-quarter grace period to meet the qualifying criteria again if an institution maintains a leverage ratio of 8 percent or greater. Temporarily under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act , as of June 2020 a banking organization with a leverage ratio of 8 percent or greater (and that meets the other existing qualifying criteria) may elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework. If needed, there is a two-quarter grace period to meet the qualifying criteria again if an institution maintains a leverage ratio of 7 percent or greater. There are transition rules in place through the beginning of 2022 to return to the Leverage Ratio requirement to greater than 9 percent."

    "definition": "( Qtly, % ) How do I create a report in SDI? Create a report in SDI by selecting 'Create or Modify Reports' from the top menu. Select the amount of columns that you wish to include in the report (from two to four). Enter your criteria for the report. You can analyze any combination of single FDIC-Insured institutions or bank holding companies, custom peer groups of FDIC-Insured institutions or bank holding companies, or standard peer groups of FDIC-Insured institutions. After completing the selection criteria, press 'Next' to continue processing. You will be at the 'Confirmation Report'. Confirm all column selections and modify the report date and/or income basis (year-to-date or quarterly) for any column. Then: Select from the 'Report Selection' box any of the predefined reports or choose 'Custom Report' to create a report of specific items of your choice. Decide to view or download the report. If 'View' is selected, you can choose to present information in dollar amounts or in percentage amounts. Press 'Next' If any of the predefined reports have been selected, the report will appear. If 'Custom Report' has been selected, you will be prompted to select those items that you wish to include in the report. After you select and review the items, press 'Add More' to include more items or 'Next' to generate the report. How are custom peer groups defined in SDI? Custom peer groups are user-defined groups of FDIC-Insured institutions or bank holding companies*. The user makes the decision of which banking entities to include in the custom peer group. SDI will then generate financial reports that calculate the financial information reported by the individual members of the peer group. These financial reports will display the peer group information in aggregate. Custom peer groups can consist of: a) the criteria used to create the peer group (unlimited membership), or b) individual institutions or bank holding companies up to up to a limit of 50 members. *Financial data for bank holding companies represent combined amounts for all FDIC-Insured bank and thrift subsidiaries, and do not reflect nondeposit subsidiaries or parent companies. Account balances have not been adjusted for intra-company transactions. Additional holding company information can be found at the website for the Federal Reserve System--National Information Center (NIC). What are standard peer groups? Standard peer groups are pre-defined and pre-calculated groups of FDIC-Insured institutions. These standard peer groups are used in FDIC publications such as the FDIC's Statistics on Banking. When possible, standard peer groups should be used instead of custom groups for faster processing. The available standard peer groups are included in the following table: Table of Standard Peer Groups What are Standard Reports? Standard Reports consist of pre-selected columns based on many of the standard peer groups that are used in FDIC publications (e.g. the FDIC's Statistics on Banking). First time users are encouraged to view the Standard Reports which may or may not meet their immediate need. These reports also provide the user with an idea of the amount of information and flexibility that is provided in SDI. To access a Standard Report, simply press the 'Run Report' option for the standard report that you wish to retrieve. The 'Assets and Liabilities' report is the default. Access any of the available SDI reports by choosing from the drop-down menu. Modify the column selections by choosing 'Create or Modify Reports' and changing the criteria. Available Standard reports I want to analyze data from SDI in a different software package. Can I download data from SDI? If so, how do I do it? Yes, you can download and save information provided by SDI. In fact, there are three distinctly different types of data download in SDI. Download data after column selections have been made. (Note: this download returns a maximum of 200 records) To download: Download larger amounts (up to 2.5 megabytes) of data without being restricted by the column selections.

In general, purchased credit card relationships are an amount paid in excess of the value of the purchased credit card receivables. Such relationships arise when the reporting bank purchases existing credit card receivables and also has the right to provide credit card services to those customers. Purchased credit card relationships may also be acquired when the reporting bank purchases an entire depository institution. Purchased credit card relationships are carried at amortized cost, not in excess of the discounted amount of estimated future net cash flows. Management of the institution reviews the carrying value at least quarterly, adequately documents this review, and adjusts the carrying value as necessary. If unanticipated acceleration or deceleration of cardholder payments, account attrition, changes in fees or finance charges, or other events occur that reduce the amount of expected future net cash flows, a write-down of the book value of the purchased credit card relationships is made to the extent that the discounted amount of estimated future net cash flows is less than the asset's carrying amount. The carrying value of nonmortgage servicing assets is the unamortized cost of acquiring contracts to service financial assets, other than loans secured by real estate, that have been securitized or are owned by another party, net of any related valuation allowances. For TFR Reporters, includes nonmortgage servicing assets beginning March 1999."

The FDIC issued a final rule (HTML | PDF – 100kb) on the One-Time Assessment Credit published on October 18, 2006. (71 Fed. Reg. 61374) (See also FDIC FIL-93-2006) As indicated in the final rule, the FDIC will provide a preliminary Statement of One-Time Credit to all eligible institutions as soon as practicable after October 18, 2006.To be eligible for the one-time credit, an institution must have been in existence on December 31, 1996, and have paid a deposit insurance assessment prior to that date, or be a “successor” to such an institution. The final rule defines a “successor” as the resulting institution in a merger or consolidation or the acquiring institution under a de facto rule. The de facto rule recognizes a transfer of at least 90 percent of an institution’s assets and deposit liabilities as a substantial divestiture of the transferring institution’s business. An institution deemed a “successor” under this rule acquires a pro rata share of the transferring institution’s assessment base ratio, for purposes of determining the one-time assessment credit. Each eligible institution's share of the assessment credit pool will be calculated by dividing its December 31, 1996 assessment base by the combined assessment base of all eligible institutions. Assessment credits will be applied to reduce deposit insurance assessments payable after the one-time credit regulations become effective. The FDIC assessment credit search tool allows an institution to view its preliminary 1996 assessment base and preliminary, estimated credit amount based on the final rule and data (including merger information) in the FDIC's records. An institution that participated in one or more mergers or consolidations (referred to as acquisitions on the report form) also may view the preliminary 1996 assessment base and preliminary, estimated credit amount attributable to such mergers or consolidations. Please note that this search tool does not include transactions that might qualify under the de facto rule. An institution may request a review of its One-Time Assessment Credit by December 18, 2006. If an institution does not submit such a request by that date, it will be barred from doing so in the future. This deadline includes claims for credits under the de facto rule. Information provided through this search tool is preliminary and estimated. The information is subject to change and might increase or decrease based on adjustments to institutions' eligibility for credits, including adjustments made under the de facto rule. If you have any questions about your 1996 assessment base, preliminary estimated credit amount, or any transaction in which your institution was involved that might affect your credit, please contact the FDIC at 1-800-759-6596."

The report is generated with the institution values, rank and percent rank along with the peer’s non weighted average, minimum, maximum, median and standard deviation values for each line item. The rank is a tie-high ordering of the data from largest to smallest, largest being equal to number 1. The Percent<= is based on the Rank and indicates the percentage of the others in the group that have a value less than or equal to the institution’s value. Quarterly and year-to-date income items are available. Custom peer groups can be comprised of institutions and/or bank holding companies. Notes on Averages: Standard peer averages ID/SDI are weighted averages . The ratio is created from the sum of the numerators and sum of the dominators.

    "definition": "The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 changed the Internal Revenue Code to allow financial institutions to elect Subchapter S corporation status, beginning in 1997. Banks are required to indicate on the Call Report whether there is currently in effect an election to file under Subchapter S. Thrifts have a similar requirement as of March 1998. The most important IRS requirements to elect and maintain Subchapter S status are: There can be no more than 75 eligible shareholders and no more than one class of stock. (In general, shareholders can only be individuals, estates, and certain types of trusts. Certain retirement plans and charitable organizations will be eligible in 1998.) All shareholders must consent. Banks and thrifts converting to Subchapter S status must use the specific charge-off method for tax purposes rather than the reserve method of accounting for bad debts and recapture tax bad debt reserves over a period of six years, if the reserve method had been used prior to conversion. (Note: even though the specific charge-off method is required for tax purposes, an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses must still be maintained on the financial statements and Call Reports.) Banks and thrifts are subject to a built-in gains (BIG) tax, if the aggregate fair market value of assets is greater than their aggregate adjusted bases on the date of conversion to Subchapter S status. [Banks are required to indicate separately on the Call Report in December of each year, the deferred portion of income taxes reported in net income. For Subchapter S banks, some or all of their deferred tax assets and liabilities may be eliminated upon conversion to Subchapter S status; however, deferred taxes related to the BIG tax and the recapture of bad debt reserves must be recognized.]. A Subchapter S corporation is treated as a pass-through entity, similar to a partnership, for federal income tax purposes. It is generally not subject to any federal income taxes at the corporate level. Its taxable income flows through to its shareholders in proportion to their stock ownership, and the shareholders generally pay federal income taxes on their share of this taxable income. This can have the effect of reducing institutions' reported income tax expense and increasing their after-tax earnings.. The election of Subchapter S status may result in an increase in shareholders' personal tax liabilities. Therefore, S corporations typically increase the amount of earnings distributed as dividends to compensate for higher personal taxes."
